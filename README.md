**CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**


This project focuses on the detection of credit card fraud using advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging a dataset of 284,807 transactions. By employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and ensemble models, particularly XGBoost, we aim to address the challenges of class imbalance and privacy in fraud detection. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy and precision, offering insights into fraud patterns and contributing to enhanced security measures in the finance sector.
